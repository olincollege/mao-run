# mao-run
_A game in which the rules are unknown_

## Our game’s vision

Mao Run is a 2D platformer game with only 1 rule: _We don’t talk about the rules._ The player has to figure out what to do with whatever visual cues provided to them on screen. Our goal is to be as infuriating as possible while keeping a certain level of enjoyment and dopamine for players to fixate on continuing.

In a way, despite its non-educative appearance and inherent silliness, Mao Run embodies the ultimate life lesson: _“You live and you learn.”_ Sometimes, what you need to do is to “just 
go for it”. As long as you have a chance to correct yourself, the possibility for trial and error (and eventual improvement) is endless. We hope you have good luck in diving headfirst into whatever the task that made you hesitant is. Meanwhile, ***enjoy our game!***

# References
Mao Run is inspired by the underlying concepts of the card game [Mao](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mao), in which all players except the gamemaster do not know the rules of the game. The particpants learn the unspoken rules whilst playing the game, which is similar to how Mao Run (2022) works.
