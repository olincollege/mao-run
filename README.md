# mao-run
_A game in which the rules are unknown_

## Our game’s vision

Mao Run is a 2D platformer game with only 1 rule: _We don’t talk about the rules._ The player has to figure out what to do with whatever visual cues provided to them on screen. Our goal is to be as infuriating as possible while keeping a certain level of enjoyment and dopamine for players to fixate on continuing.

In a way, despite its inherent silliness and non-educative appearance, Mao Run embodies the ultimate life lesson: _“You live and you learn.”_ Sometimes, what you need to do is to “just 
go for it”. As long as you have a chance to correct yourself, the possibility for trial and error (and eventual improvement) is endless. We hope you have good luck in diving headfirst into whatever the task that made you hesitant is. Meanwhile, *[enjoy our game!]
